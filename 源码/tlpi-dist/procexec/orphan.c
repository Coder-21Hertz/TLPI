/* Supplementary program for Chapter Z */

/* orphan.c

   Demonstrate how a child becomes orphaned (and adopted by init(1))
   when its parent exits.

   Change history:
   2019-02-15   Changes to allow for the fact that on systems with a modern
                init(1) (e.g., systemd), an orphaned child may be adopted
                by a "child subreaper" process whose PID is not 1.
