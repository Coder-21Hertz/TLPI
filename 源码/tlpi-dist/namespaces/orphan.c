   Demonstrate that a child becomes orphaned (and is adopted by init(1),
   whose PID is 1) when its parent exits.

   See https://lwn.net/Articles/532748/

   Change history:
   2019-02-15   Changes to allow for the fact that on systems with a modern
                init(1) (e.g., systemd), an orphaned child may be adopted
                by a "child subreaper" process whose PID is not 1.
